Public information about VLT Carioca

In july 2017, [nighto](http://github.com/nighto) sent to Rio de Janeiro city hall a Public Information Request under [Lei de Acesso à Informação](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2011/lei/l12527.htm), asking about public information regarding VLT tramway. It was forwarded to [CDURP - Companhia de Desenvolvimento Urbano da Região do Porto do Rio de Janeiro](http://cdurp.com.br/). Originally the request asked for real time information, which was denied. But they've shared some static information about VLT, which you can check on the list above.
